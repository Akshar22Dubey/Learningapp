            <h2>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</h2>
            <p >Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
            How I wonder what you are!
            Up above the world so high,
            Like a diamond in the sky.
            
            When the blazing sun is gone,
            When he nothing shines upon,
            Then you show your little light,
            Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
            
            Then the traveler in the dark
            Thanks you for your tiny spark;
            He could not see which way to go,
            If you did not twinkle so.
            
            In the dark blue sky you keep,
            And often through my curtains peep,
            For you never shut your eye
            Till the sun is in the sky.
            
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
            How I wonder what you are!
            Up above the world so high,
            Like a diamond in the sky.

            <h2>Rainbow Friends</h2>
            <p >Red, orange, yellow, green,
            The brightest colors ever seen.
            Blue, indigo, and violet too,
            Painting rainbows just for you.
            
            With colors bold and bright,
            We dance and laugh with all our might.
            Hand in hand, we skip along,
            Singing a happy, joyful song.
            
            Rainbow friends, forever true,
            We'll stick together just like glue.
            With love and kindness, we will blend,
            Colors of the rainbow, our truest friends.

            <h2>The Silly Monkey</h2>
            <p >There was a silly monkey,
            With fur so soft and funky.
            He swung from tree to tree,
            As happy as can be.
            
            He made funny faces,
            And played in all the spaces.
            Jumping and hopping around,
            Making silly monkey sounds.
            
            With a mischievous grin,
            He would always win.
            The silly monkey, oh so wild,
            Was loved by every child.

            When I get all steamed up, hear me shout,

            I'm a very special pot, it's true,
            Here's an example of what I can do.
            I can change my handle and my spout,
            Just tilt me over and pour me out!
